# 🚀 My JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting how I learned **JavaScript from scratch**. This is more than just code — it's a timeline of my growth, challenges, breakthroughs, and progress toward mastering one of the most powerful languages in web development.

## 📚 Why This Repo?

When I first started learning JavaScript, I was overwhelmed by the endless tutorials and resources. So, I decided to take a hands-on approach: learn, build, break, and document.

This repo serves as:
- 📓 A personal log of everything I’ve learned
- 🧠 A reference for future me
- 🔗 A resource for anyone starting from zero
- 🛠️ A place to build small and big projects as I grow

## 🛤️ My Learning Path

I structured my journey in phases:

### 1. Fundamentals
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Functions and Scope
- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Listeners
- Arrays & Objects

### 2. Intermediate Concepts
- Higher-Order Functions
- ES6+ Features (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
- Asynchronous JS (Callbacks, Promises, async/await)
- LocalStorage and SessionStorage
- Error Handling

### 3. Advanced Topics
- OOP in JavaScript (Classes, Prototypes)
- Closures & Execution Context
- Event Loop & Call Stack
- Fetch API and working with APIs
- Modules and Tooling (import/export, bundlers)


## 🔧 Tools & Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- VSCode


## 📅 Timeline

This journey started in `Month Year` and is actively being updated as I go deeper into frameworks like React, Node.js, and beyond.
